# wpCssFramework
CSS Framework with a tiny footprint, developed over time and used in commercial projects to speed up development of themes.

A complete bare-bones CSS framework, perfect for hand-coding WordPress professionals, who want a quick and simply solution for creating mobile ready themes.

Who is the framework for? It was created for myself, so I can literally hit the ground running with new client projects, without the necessity of using popular frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation. The framework wasn’t designed as an “end-all” solution, rather as a wire-frame that supports the main stylesheet.

What is wpCssFramework? It’s a styling framework used on its own, or in combo with the Bones theme, together I can create any theme. My specialist area of design is recreating WordPress themes from HTML websites, and many of the older sites aren’t mobile compatible, simply slotting in wpCssFramework’s break point classes, makes them instantly mobile ready.
